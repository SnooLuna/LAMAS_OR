# Theory
## Topic Introduction
For this project we will try to construct a riddle which showcases how many layers of logic a human comprehends based on its final answer. This can be very useful when investigating how humans process riddles for higher theory of mind. We can formalize this in the following research question. 

**Research question:** Can we construct an epistemic riddle using a linear Kripke model such that the length of the 'A knows that B knows...' prefix in a public announcement leads to a unique wrong answer for every level of ToM that the solver fails to process?

We would argue that most normal riddles assume a Kripke model in S5, which is why this is the basis of our first approach. However, it might be possible to construct riddles in which our Kripke model does not have to be symmetric or transitive. We think a desired Kripke model corresponding to our riddle should always be reflexive, since agents within the riddle are always thought of as perfect logicians. Without reflexivity, a public announcement would lose power, as agents could 'know' things that are factually false, breaking the logical consistency of the riddle's solution. Therefore, we will focus on reflexive Kripke models.
