This should have a detailed introduction section with references and everything, introduce all 3 approaches we have.

# Topic Introduction
For this project we will try to construct a riddle which showcases how many orders of Theory of Mind someone comprehends based on their final answer. This can be very useful when investigating how humans process riddles for higher theory of mind. We can formalize this in the following research question.

**Research question:** Is there a combination of Kripke model and set of announcements such that when combined into a riddle, can distinguish between the orders of Theory of Mind used by the solver by the answer they give?

We originally assume that our riddle will be able to make use of S5 and that this is also an intuitive way of thinking for people solving riddles (References for this to be added.), which is why this is the basis of our first approach. If this proves to be impossible, we will also consider riddles that make use of Kripke models that are not symmetric or transitive. We do think a desired Kripke model corresponding to our riddle should always be reflexive, since agents within the riddle are always thought of as perfect logicians. Without reflexivity, a public announcement would lose power, as agents could ‘know’ things that are factually false, breaking the logical consistency of the riddle’s solution. Therefore, we will focus on reflexive Kripke models.
