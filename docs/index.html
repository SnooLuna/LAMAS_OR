<h1>{{ "LAMAS Final Project - Group OR" }}</h1>

<p>
This website presents the final project for the course Logic, Agents, and Multi-Agent Systems.
We study epistemic riddles using Kripke models and public announcement logic, with a particular focus on
distinguishing different orders of Theory of Mind, where the order indicates the level of nested reasoning about
other agents’ knowledge.
  
We analyze a class of Kripke models in which such orders cannot be distinguished by our announcement scheme.
Finally, we attempt to construct riddles that do distinguish between orders, and we implement a solver that searches
for such riddles across a large set of Kripke models.
