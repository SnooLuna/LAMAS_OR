# Conclusion


# Other ideas
  
Most of the other ideas focus on finding a solution such that every layer corresponds to a unique world. This could be done by changing the layers or changing the Kripke model.
  
-   Maybe it is possible with unique worlds as answers when we focus on $K_B\phi$, $K_BK_AK_B\phi$ and $K_BK_AK_BK_AK_B\phi$ or $K_B\phi$, $K_BK_A\phi$ and $K_BK_AK_B\phi$
  
-   We could also use $\neg K$ instead of $K$, maybe that changes things
  
-   What about three agents $A$, $B$ and $C$? Could we then also construct these layers?
  
-   What about non reflexive Kripke models, it should be possible to construct a Kripke world such that every layer corresponds with a unique world, but is it possible to construct a riddle from such a model?
