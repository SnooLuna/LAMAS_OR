# LAMAS
Final project for the LAMAS course by group OR

The code for our solver can be found in the src directory, with a requirements file attached. All code can be found in the jupyter notebook Solver.ipynb, which has also been compiled into a pdf version found in the same directory in case it cannot be opened. 

Our report related to this repository can be found on [the Github Pages site created by this repository](https://snooluna.github.io/LAMAS_OR)
